A few test cases for a prime factorizer program. First, the program prompts the user with "Enter your number here:".
After the user enters a number, the program will return the prime factors.
In this example, the program factorizes 9, 45, 372, 28394738, and 128372943.
When the user types "exit", the program will panic and exit, telling the user, "Non-integer input detected. Exiting program."
